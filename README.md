# face-tracking-using-pie-and-servo
This project is a real-time face tracking system built using a Raspberry Pi, a webcam, and two servo motors (for pan and tilt). It uses OpenCV for face detection and RPi.GPIO to control the servo motors. The system detects faces in the video stream and adjusts the servos to keep the detected face centered in the frame.
